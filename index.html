        <p>Spring Fair is an exciting time for <a href="http://albanypreschool.org/">Albany Preschool</a>. It's the biggest bash that our  students (and our co-op parents) throw every year &mdash; enjoying seasonal fun and games, whilst also aiming to raise as much funding as possible to help keep our beloved preschool running. APS has been a community staple for local kids since it first opened back in 1937.</p>

        <p>This will be the first Spring Fair since 2019, and we aim to make it a good one! There will be staple activities like the APS raffle, a box maze and plethora of baked goods for all to enjoy. Additionally,  we will host our inaugural <strong>APS Bike-A-Thon</strong> event for cyclists of all ages.</p>

        
        <p>Sponsored by <a href="https://www.xtracycle.com/">Xtracycle</a>, who are providing prizes.</p>

        <p>The route is a simple triangle utilizing the Ohlone Greenway, to ensure a simple and safe journey for riders of all ages.</p>
        <p>Participants will have 30 mins to ride laps of the route, which will be tallied and scores used to solicit donations for APS.</p>
        <h2>Fundraising</h2>
        <p>The goal is for participants to collect sponsors, who will donate <em>per lap</em> cycled! This will be handled through a <a href="https://givebutter.com/"">Give Butter</a> campaign page, which will be added soon.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, a $20 registration donation can be offered for those who would rather cycle at a more casual party pace!</p>
